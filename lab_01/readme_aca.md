# Due Date

Week 2 Monday 6:00 pm [Sydney Local Time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/australia/sydney)

# Background

## Rationale

Universities are made up of staff and students, each of whom is associated with one or more courses.
Many staff are also students themselves, formally or not, for we will always have something new to learn.

In this lab, students and staff will be referred to as academics.  Our goal is to follow an interface and complete a piece of software that allows academics to browse through an existing data store and discover their connections with other academics and courses. In our currently divided world, it is more important than ever to stay connected with those who share our interests.

## Setup

- If you are working on a CSE machine (e.g. via VLAB), ensure that you've run the command 1531 setup. You only need to do this once at the beginning of the course.
- Please make sure you have completed both lab01_git and lab01_leap prior.
- Copy the SSH clone link from Gitlab and clone this repository on either VLAB or your local machine. 
- In your terminal, change your directory (using the cd command) to the newly cloned lab. To check if you have done this correctly, type ls in this new directory to see if you can see the relevant files (including [academics.js](academics.js)).

## Interface: Functions

An *interface* describes the characteristics of functions without concern for how they are implemented.

Below is an interface for the functions inside [academic.js](academics.js). Each function has:
 * A function name in the source code
 * A list of parameters that they take in
 * A return object
 * Specific behaviour in cases where invalid input is provided

*NOTE: this lab expects an **object* to be returned, rather than the primitive value (e.g. string/number). 
This is denoted by the curly braces, {}. For example, you need to return { numAcademics: 999 } and *not* just 999. Refer to the [Interface: Data Types](#interface-data-types) section for further details regarding types.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name & Description</th>
    <th>Parameters</th>
    <th>Return Type (Object)</th>
    <th>Errors</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
        <code>getNumAcademics</code><br /><br />
        Returns an object with information about the number of academics in the data store.
        <br/><br/><b>Difficulty</b>: ⭐

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
        <code>checkAcademicIsMember</code><br /><br />
        Returns an object that contains information about whether an academic is a member of the given course.
        <br/><br/><b>Difficulty</b>: ⭐⭐
    </td>
    <td>
        <code>(academicId, courseId)</code>
    </td>
    <td>
        <code>{isMember}</code>
    </td>
    <td>
        Return <code>{error}</code> when:
        <ul>
          <li>there are no academics with the given id</li>
          <li>there are no courses with the given id</li>
        </ul> 
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
        <code>checkAcademicIsStaff</code><br /><br />
        Returns an object that contains information about whether an academic is a staff of the given course.
        <br/><br/><b>Difficulty</b>: ⭐⭐
    </td>
    <td>
        <code>(academicId, courseId)</code>
    </td>
    <td>
        <code>{isStaff}</code>
    </td>
    <td>
        Return <code>{error}</code> when:
        <ul>
          <li>there are no academics with the given id</li>
          <li>there are no courses with the given id</li>
        </ul> 
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

For example, the function getAcademicDetailsFromId would be called as follows:
javascript
const academicId = 10;
const result = getAcademicDetailsById(academicId);
console.log(result);


Which would print to the terminal (with different white-space) an object with key academic as follows:
text
{
  academic: {
    name: 'Ada',
    hobby: 'music'
  }
};


And if an invalid parameter was passed in, the returned result will be:
text
{ error: 'a relevant error message of your choice' }


*Bonus*: one way to check if a function is returning an object containing the key 'error' is:
typescript
const academicId = -999; // something invalid
const result = getAcademicDetailsById(academicId);
if ('error' in result) {
  // handle the error
}


## Interface: Data Types

This is only regarding the input/output of the functions in the [Interface: Functions](#interface-functions) and has no relation to the data object (implementation). Sometimes the implementation data types will very closely align, but there is no expectation they do.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>If a variable name...</th>
    <th>It is of type...</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>named exactly <b>error</b></td>
    <td><code>string</code>, with the value being a relevant error message of your choice</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>contains suffix <b>Id</b></td>
    <td><code>number</code>, specifically integer.<br/>Note: all ids of a category are unique for that category (e.g. there will not be a repeated <code>academicId</code>)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>contains prefix <b>num</b></td>
    <td><code>number</code>, specifically integer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(outputs only) named exactly <b>academic</b></td>
    <td><code>object</code> containing keys <code>{name, hobby}</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(outputs only) named exactly <b>course</b></td>
    <td><code>object</code> containing keys <code>{name, description}</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>named exactly <b>name</b></td>
    <td><code>string</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>named exactly <b>hobby</b></td>
    <td><code>string</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>named exactly <b>description</b></td>
    <td><code>string</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>contains prefix <b>is</b></td>
    <td><code>boolean</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Implementation: Data Store

The simplest way to store data without using complex software is in a global variable.

In your major project, we will expect you to create this variable and decide how it is structured. *However, for simplicity, in this lab, we are forcing your implementation to work on a specific data structure*. We have populated the data store with information for you.

You can see in [academics.js](academics.js) that we've created a global variable called dataStore. The object contains multiple key-value pairs, where each value is itself an array of objects.

For this lab, the global variable dataStore is pre-populated with data.

javascript
const dataStore = {
  academics: [
    {
      id: 10,
      name: 'Ada',
      hobby: 'music',
    },
    {
      id: 20,
      name: 'Ben',
      hobby: 'gym',
    },
    // ...
  ],

  courses: [
    {
      id: 1511,
      name: 'COMP1511',
      description: 'Programming Fundamentals',
      staffIds: [10, 20],
      memberIds: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
    },
    {
      id: 1531,
      name: 'COMP1531',
      description: 'Programming Fundamentals',
      staffIds: [10],
      memberIds: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
    },
    // ...
  ],
}


For this academic exercise, do *NOT* modify the fields in the data object (e.g. by adding new key/values). However, you can add/remove an academic or a course when self-testing - see the [Testing](#testing) section for further information.

In the current design, a staff in the course is a member of that course.

In *future* lab exercises, you can (and are encouraged to) modify any data structure as you see fit. Our auto-marking tests in *future* exercises will not rely on the underlying structure of the data store.

# Task

Your task is to *implement the functions in [Interface](#interface-functions)*.

## Implementation

Open the file [academics.js](./academics.js) in your preferred text editor. The stub code (interface with a fake temporary implementation) for each function has been provided for you.

Before replacing them with your implementation, pay close attention to the returned object and see how it aligns with the [Interface: Functions](#interface-fuctions) and [Interface: Data Types](#interface-data-types).

Complete the functions getNumAcademics, getNumCourses, getAcademicDetailsFromId, getCourseDetailsFromId, checkAcademicIsMember, checkAcademicIsStaff.

## Run & Test

You can run and test your code by typing the following in a terminal that is opened at the directory (folder) for this lab:
shell
$ node academics.js

This executes the code in [academics.js](academics.js), including the console.log at the bottom of the file.

## Output format of console.log

When debugging your code, you may find that the output of console.log has:
- different colours (e.g. yellow/brown for numbers)
- different spacing (e.g. spaces between brackets)
- new lines (e.g. after an opening bracket)
- other slight differences in indentation, commas, etc

This is completely fine. What matters is the returned value of your functions, which is what we will be assessing you on.

Using console.log is strictly for debugging purposes. It will not affect your mark in any way. In other words, how your results are displayed when printed or whether you leave these console.log statements in your code has 0 effects on your final automarking result.

### Tips for Printing Objects

For objects with deeply-nested structures, sometimes they may show up when printed with console.log as [Object] or [Array]. In this case, what you can do is convert them to a JSON string before printing, e.g.
javascript
// rather than:
console.log(yourDeeplyNestedObject);

// we can do:
console.log(JSON.stringify(yourDeeplyNestedObject, null, 2));

The third argument, "2", will pretty-print your object with 2 space indentation. You can view the documentation for JSON.stringify [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify).

## Testing
In the auto-marking, we will replace the data store with other information. However, you are guaranteed that the structure will be identical (i.e keys/values), and only the number of academics and courses will change.

For example, we may add/remove an academic, add/remove a course, change an academic's name or id, change a course's name or id, or have an empty dataStore such as:
javascript
const dataStore = {
  academics: [],
  courses: [],
};

You can assume that the types of all parameters will be consistent with the [Interface: Data Types](#interface-data-types) section.

# Submission

- Use git to add, commit, and push your changes on your master branch.
- Check that your code has been uploaded to your Gitlab repository on this website (you may need to refresh the page).

*If you have pushed your latest changes to master on Gitlab no further action is required! At the due date and time, we automatically collect your work from what's on your master branch on Gitlab.*

# Notes
- We will only test the behaviour explicitly defined in the specification. For cases that are not covered, you can make assumptions about how the relevant functions should behave.
- Passing the given tests is a good indication of correctness but does not guarantee that you will receive the full mark for the lab.
- You are advised to do further testing. In this lab, this can be done by adding more console.log at the bottom of [academics.js](academics.js)
- You are not allowed to use any external libraries/modules in this exercise. This simply means that your code should run on a CSE machine without needing to use the npm install command
